What is the difference between DNA and RNA? | basics | DNA is double-stranded with deoxyribose sugar and thymine base, stable for long-term storage. RNA is single-stranded with ribose sugar and uracil base, versatile for various functions including protein synthesis.
How does translation differ from transcription? | processes | Transcription copies DNA to RNA in nucleus, producing mRNA. Translation decodes mRNA to protein at ribosomes in cytoplasm, using tRNA to bring amino acids. Transcription is DNA-dependent RNA synthesis; translation is RNA-dependent protein synthesis.
Explain dominant vs recessive alleles | inheritance | Dominant alleles express their trait when one copy is present (heterozygous). Recessive alleles require two copies (homozygous) for expression. In heterozygous individuals, dominant masks recessive phenotype, but recessive allele can still be transmitted.

Over generations, advantageous traits increase in frequency, making populations better adapted.
